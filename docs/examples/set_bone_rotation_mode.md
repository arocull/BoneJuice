# Set Bone Rotation Mode
In Pose mode, select the bones you want to edit, then go to `Pose > Set Rotation Mode`. Choose the rotation mode you want, and all selected pose bones will be set to the new rotation mode. Note that if the bones already have a keyframed rotation, these keyframes will not be converted to the new rotation mode, and you may run into issues with rotation channels clashing.
